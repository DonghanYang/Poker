- [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) is a complete guide of the poker hands descriptions and rankings
- Ensure all files are in the same folder and compile using `javac Poker.java`
- Run the program using `java Poker` and input your cards
- Cards should be entered on the command line as two-character strings, the first being an `A` for `Ace`, `K` for `King`, `Q` for `Queen`, `J` for `Jack`, `T` for `Ten`, or digit between 2 and 9 for ranks 2-9. The second character should be a `C` for `Clubs`, `D` for `Diamonds`, `H` for `Hearts`, or `S` for `Spades`. Both upper and lower case characters are supported.
- `Aces` are the highest rank. `Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5` is not considered as a straight (or straight flush)
